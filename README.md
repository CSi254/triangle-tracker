# Program name: 
triangle-tracker

# Author name:John Gatheru

# Description of project:-
The module created here will help  you identify what type of triangle you have by collecting the leanths you have put in i.e(Isosceles,Equilateral or even a Scalane.

This module is able to calculate and give you an answer which is accurate acording to the code. The project is open for changes froim all sources and any improvements needed to satisfiy the user will be highly apriciated.

# Setup Instruction


* Clone the project from my repository by clicking on the clone button.
* Copy the link
* Open the terminal and write git clone then paste the link on the directory you want to place the project.
* Open the directory then open the index.html file on the browser to run the program.


# The Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)
This project starts from as simle as an alert box which is only open when you click a button called "CLICK ME".
The button "CLICK ME" helps one in commanding the alert box in poping up on the page and entering the values for each side of the triangle.


|Behaviour                     |  Input                        | Output            |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|
|the program recognizes values which all sides are equal.| First number =4 second number =4 third number =4 |Equilateral triangle|
|the program recognizes values which two sides are equal.| First number =3 second number =3 third number =5 |Isosceles triangle|
|the program recognizes sum of two sides is equal or less than the thrid side.|First number =3 second number =4 third number =8| Not a triangle |
|the program recognizes sum of two sides is equal or greator than the third side .|first number =3 second number =4 third number =6 | Scalene triangle |


The Program recognizes length set to zero(0) or is less than zero
INPUT EXAMPLE : sideA = 0 sideB = 60 sideC = 30

OUTPUT EXAMPLE : Length of sides cannot be equal to or less than zero

The Program recognizes lengths that are Equal
INPUT EXAMPLE : sideA = 60 sideB = 60 sideC = 60

OUTPUT EXAMPLE: The Triangle is an EQUILATERAL

The Program recognizes two lengths that are Equal

INPUT EXAMPLE : sideA = 60 sideB = 60 sideC = 30

OUTPUT EXAMPLET: The Triangle is an ISOSCELES

The Program recognizes lengths that are unequal

INPUT EXAMPLE : sideA = 30 sideB = 40 sideC = 60

OUTPUT EXAMPLE: The triangle is a SCALENE

The Program recognizes lengths that do not form a triangle

INPUT EXAMPLE : sideA = 50 sideB = 30 sideC = 90

OUTPUT EXAMPLE: This NOT A TRIANGLE

The Program recognizes empty fields or invalid characters like text

Input : sideA = a sideB = "" sideC = 90

OUTPUT EXAMPLE: PLEASE ENTETR A NUMBER. EMPTY FIELDS OR WRONG INPUTS
